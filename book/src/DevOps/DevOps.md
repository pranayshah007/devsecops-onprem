By Implementing DevOps practice, we achieve the below aspects :

1) Short build cycle and frequent release cycles

2) Multi-environment synergy 

3) Release day is treated as a normal day as releases are being pushed into production every few hours.

4) Scaling up the infrastructure is a lot more easy and requires less manpower
